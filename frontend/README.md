This is a boilerplate [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project with [Wagmi.sh](https://wagmi.sh) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). 

## Getting Started

First, install the components:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, set your environment variables in .env.local in the root of the project:
(The prefix NEXT_PUBLIC is mandatory)

NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_API=...


Finally start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can connect your wallet and start experimenting with wagmi.sh.
You can connect your editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
